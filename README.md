# Tasker Trigger

Trigger your existing Tasker tasks from your Garmin watch with a single tap.  
This app uses the [AutoNotification](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autonotification) plugin on Android to bridge Garmin and Tasker.  

[Get the app on the Garmin Connect IQ Store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/07e1de26-99e5-46e3-92d9-7d30f7f92bdd)
